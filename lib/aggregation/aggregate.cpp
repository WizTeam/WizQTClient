    \namespace Aggregation
    \brief The Aggregation namespace contains support for bundling related components,
           such that each component exposes the properties and behavior of the
           other components to the outside.

    Components that are bundled to an Aggregate can be "cast" to each other
    and have a coupled life cycle. See the documentation of Aggregation::Aggregate for
    details and examples.

    \class Aggregation::Aggregate

    \brief The Aggregate class defines a collection of related components that
    can be viewed as a unit.

    An Aggregate is a collection of components that are handled as a unit,
    such that each component exposes the properties and behavior of the
    other components in the Aggregate to the outside.
    Specifically that means:
    \list
    \li They can be "cast" to each other (using query and query_all functions).
    \li Their life cycle is coupled, i.e. whenever one is deleted all of them are.
    \endlist
    Components can be of any QObject derived type.

    You can use an Aggregate to simulate multiple inheritance by aggregation. Assume we have
    \code
        using namespace Aggregation;
        class MyInterface : public QObject { ........ };
        class MyInterfaceEx : public QObject { ........ };
        [...]
        MyInterface *object = new MyInterface; // this is single inheritance
    \endcode
    The query function works like a qobject_cast with normal objects:
    \code
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterface>(object) == object);
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterfaceEx>(object) == 0);
    \endcode
    If we want 'object' to also implement the class MyInterfaceEx,
    but don't want to or cannot use multiple inheritance, we can do it
    at any point using an Aggregate:
    \code
        MyInterfaceEx *objectEx = new MyInterfaceEx;
        Aggregate *aggregate = new Aggregate;
        aggregate->add(object);
        aggregate->add(objectEx);
    \endcode
    The Aggregate bundles the two objects together.
    If we have any part of the collection we get all parts:
    \code
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterface>(object) == object);
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterfaceEx>(object) == objectEx);
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterface>(objectEx) == object);
        Q_ASSERT(query<MyInterfaceEx>(objectEx) == objectEx);
    \endcode
    The following deletes all three: object, objectEx and aggregate:
    \code
        delete objectEx;
        // or delete object;
        // or delete aggregate;
    \endcode

    Aggregation aware code never uses qobject_cast, but always uses
    Aggregation::query which behaves like a qobject_cast as a fallback.
